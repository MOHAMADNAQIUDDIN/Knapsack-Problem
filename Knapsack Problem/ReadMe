This file consist of project for Knapsack Problem- Maximizing Carry-On Luggage for Travelling using Flight

Introduction:
The knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which it must be calculate
based on the amount of each object to include in a collection such that the total weight is less 
than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible given a set of objects, 
each with a weight and a value. It gets its name from the dilemma that anyone with a fixed-size 
knapsack faces when they have to fill it with the most important objects. The issue often occurs 
in resource allocation, where decision makers must select from a collection of non-divisible 
projects or tasks when working under a strict budget or time constraint.

In this case study, knapsack problem is used based on the carry-on luggage that one person can 
bring with them on flight. An aeroplane plays a vital role in the economics and travel sectors. 
Usually, people take an aeroplane to travel inside and outside of a country. Furthermore, people 
brought luggage which usually full of clothes, food or souvenir while travelling. Sadly, there's 
a weight limit for carry-on luggage that one person can bring with them on the flight. As an 
example, it is Malaysia Airports rules and regulations that luggage allowed onto the aircraft 
should not exceed maximum weight of 7kg. Based on the Knapsack problem, we will 
maximize the weight of luggage that one person can bring on the flight with the limit that 
airlines have set by using Simple Genetic Algorithm
